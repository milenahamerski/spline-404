## Design Inspiration

The 404 page design is inspired by the final scene of _The Truman Show_. In this memorable scene, Truman Burbank exits his artificially created world and faces a vast, unending sky wall with a boat sailing towards it. This imagery is used to evoke a sense of being lost and transitioning from one reality to another, making it a fitting metaphor for a 404 error page.
